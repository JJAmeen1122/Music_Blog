            <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
            <pre>
                First things first
                I'ma say all the words inside my head
                I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
                The way that things have been, oh-ooh
                Second things second
                Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
                I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
                The master of my sea, oh-ooh
                
              
                I was broken from a young age
                Taking my sulking to the masses
                Writing my poems for the few
                That look to me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
                Singing from heartache from the pain
                Taking my message from the veins
                Speaking my lesson from the brain
                Seeing the beauty through the...
                
              
                Pain!
                You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
                Pain!
                You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
                Pain!
                Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
                My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
                Pain!
                You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
                
               
                Third things third
                Send a prayer to the ones up above
                All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
                Your spirit up above, oh-ooh
                
                
                I was choking in the crowd
                Building my rain up in the cloud
                Falling like ashes to the ground
                Hoping my feelings, they would drown
                But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
                Inhibited, limited
                Till it broke open and rained down
                And rained down, like...
                
               
                Pain!
                You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
                Pain!
                You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
                Pain!
                Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
                My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
                Pain!
                You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
                
                
                Last things last
                By the grace of the fire and the flame
                You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
                The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
                But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
                Inhibited, limited
                Till it broke open and rained down
                And rained down, like...
                
              
                Pain!
                You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
                Pain!
                You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
                Pain!
                Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
                My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
                Pain!
                You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</pre>
