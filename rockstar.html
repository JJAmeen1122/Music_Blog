                Post Malone â€“ Rockstar (ft. 21 Savage)


                    Ayy, I've been f***in' hoes and poppin' pillies
                    Man, I feel just like a rockstar
                    All my brothers got that gas and they always be smokin' like a Rasta
                    F***in' with me, call up on a Uzi and show up, man them the shottas
                    When my homies pull up on your block, they make that thing go grat-ta-ta-ta
           

                    Ayy, I've been f***in' hoes and poppin' pillies
                    Man, I feel just like a rockstar
                    All my brothers got that gas and they always be smokin' like a Rasta
                    F***in' with me, call up on a Uzi and show up, man them the shottas
                    When my homies pull up on your block, they make that thing go grat-ta-ta-ta
            
                
                    Ayy, switch my whip, came back in black
                    I'm startin' sayin' "Rest in peace to Bon Scott"
                    Close that door, we blowin' smoke, she ask me light a fire like a Marsah
                    Act a fool on stage, prolly leave my show in a cop car
                    Shit was legendary, threw a TV out the window of the Montage
                    Coked up on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
                    Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
                    Saying I'm with the band
            

                    Ayy, I've been f***in' hoes and poppin' pillies
                    Man, I feel just like a rockstar
                    All my brothers got that gas and they always be smokin' like a Rasta
                    F***in' with me, call up on a Uzi and show up, man them the shottas
                    When my homies pull up on your block, they make that thing go grat-ta-ta-ta
            
                  
                    I've been in the Hills, fuckin' superstars
                    Feelin' like a pop star
                    Drinkin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
                    And they ain't got no bra
                    Hit her from the back, pullin' on the tracks
                    And now she screamin' out no mas
                    They like, "Savage, why you got a 12-car garage?"
                    And you only got six cars
                    I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that?
                    Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack
                    Green Hunters in my safe, I got old racks
                    L.A. bitches always askin' where the coke at
                    Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a coupe, car
                    Smash that on a coupe, car
