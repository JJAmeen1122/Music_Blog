                Ariana Grande â€“ 34+35

                You might think I'm crazy
                The way I've been craving
                If I put it quite plainly
                Just give me them babies
                So what you doing tonight?
                Better say, "Doing you right"

                34, 35
                Baby, you might need a seatbelt
                When I ride it
                I'ma leave it open like a door
                Come inside it
                Even though I'm wetter than expected
                I'ma slide in
