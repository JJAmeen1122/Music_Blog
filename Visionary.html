            <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
            <pre>
                Kendrick Lamar ‚Äì Visionary
            
                Yeah, I‚Äôm on a mission, got my vision clear
                From the bottom to the top, now the future‚Äôs near
                They told me I couldn‚Äôt, but now I‚Äôm here
                I‚Äôm a visionary, no doubt, no fear
            
                They said it‚Äôs all a dream, but I‚Äôm wide awake
                Every challenge I face, I‚Äôm gonna elevate
                I see the world changing, it‚Äôs time to create
                As a visionary, I‚Äôm ready to take my place
            
                
                Visionary, I‚Äôm the one they never see
                Rising higher, breaking all limits to be free
                Visionary, I‚Äôm a force that they can‚Äôt deny
                I‚Äôm on my way, reaching for the sky
            
                Every move I make, every step I take
                I‚Äôm carving my path, for my future‚Äôs sake
                No distractions, no time to waste
                I‚Äôm a visionary, destined for first place
            
                The journey‚Äôs tough, but I‚Äôve got the heart
                From the streets to the stage, I‚Äôm making art
                Every setback, I turn into a spark
                Now they all know me, I‚Äôve left my mark
            
                Visionary, I‚Äôm the one they never see
                Rising higher, breaking all limits to be free
                Visionary, I‚Äôm a force that they can‚Äôt deny
                I‚Äôm on my way, reaching for the sky
            
                Yeah, I‚Äôm a visionary, no time to stand still
                Always pushing forward, chasing that thrill
                They didn‚Äôt believe, but now they will
                I‚Äôve got my vision, I‚Äôm climbing that hill
            
                Visionary, I‚Äôm the one they never see
                Rising higher, breaking all limits to be free
                Visionary, I‚Äôm a force that they can‚Äôt deny
                I‚Äôm on my way, reaching for the sky
