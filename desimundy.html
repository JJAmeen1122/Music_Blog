            <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
            <pre>
                AP Dhillon ‚Äì Desi Nightmare 

                Yeah, I'm on my grind, I'm on my way
                Coming from the streets, they said I wouldn‚Äôt stay
                Gotta hustle hard, every single day
                Now they see me shine, now they wanna play
                
                I'm living the dream, but the nightmare's real
                All this pain, but I don't wanna heal
                Every step I take, it's a dangerous deal
                But I rise above, I know how to feel
                
                
                Desi nightmares, chasing me at night
                But I keep pushing, I keep fighting for the light
                They said I couldn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm proving them wrong
                Desi nightmare, but I‚Äôm still going strong
                
               
                Money and fame, they‚Äôre the cost of my soul
                But I stay true, gotta keep control
                From the highs to the lows, I don‚Äôt fold
                My story‚Äôs untold, but the future is gold
                
                From the streets of Punjab to the global stage
                I‚Äôm a warrior, turning every page
                They said I couldn‚Äôt do it, but I‚Äôm setting the pace
                Now they see my name, I‚Äôm a legend in this race
                
                
                Desi nightmares, chasing me at night
                But I keep pushing, I keep fighting for the light
                They said I couldn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm proving them wrong
                Desi nightmare, but I‚Äôm still going strong
                
              
                You can‚Äôt stop me now, I'm on the rise
                Every enemy is a lesson in disguise
                I‚Äôll fight till the end, I‚Äôll never compromise
                The desi nightmare, it‚Äôs a part of my drive
                
              
                Yeah, Desi nightmare, you can‚Äôt take me down
                From the top of the game, I‚Äôm wearing the crown
                Desi nightmare, but I hold my ground
                Every battle I face, I‚Äôm still unbound</pre>
